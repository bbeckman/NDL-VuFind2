      <h2>Other Finna search services</h2>
      <p>Finna is a search service entity containing several sites in addition to the nationwide finna.fi site. The content of organisation-specific sites is usually limited to the material of those individual organisations.</p>
      <p>Finna is continuously evolving, and it is gradually replacing the user interfaces of all Finnish libraries, archives and museums. At the moment, <a href="https://www.finna.fi/Content/organisations?lng=en-gb">more than 100 organisations</a> are involved in Finna, the following of which have opened their own Finna search functions:</p>

    <div class="page-content">
      <p>At the moment, some Finnish libraries, archives and museums are yet to join Finna, but new ones keep enlisting. Our goal is that most national memory organisations, including all public libraries, will adopt Finna by 2020. If your library, archive or museum is not yet a Finna organisation, please contact their customer service.</p>

      <h2>Digital resources</h2>
      <h4>International, scientific e-materials</h4>
      <p>The university of applied sciences and university library Finna sites contain international, scientific and electronic library material compiled and provided by an outsourced party for a fee. Most of this material is limited to students and staff of the institutions of higher education in question. Access the digital resources by logging in to <a href="#organisation-views">your library's Finna website</a> using the username provided by your institution of higher education.</p>
      <h4>Finna replaces Nelli</h4>
      <p>The Nelli portal, used by libraries to offer digital resources, particularly magazines, to their customers, is one of the services to be replaced by Finna. Nelli will be phased out from all Finnish libraries by the end of 2016. After this, the digital resources will be available from <a href="#organisation-views">your library’s local Finna</a> or other service provided by your library for this purpose. Contact your library’s customer service for more information.</p>

      <h2>Finna is much more than a search service</h2>
      <p>Through Finna, you can not only search for material, but also gain access to it. Currently, the following <strong>libraries</strong> provide functions for reserving material, renewing loans and other activities in Finna:</p>
      <?=$this->partial('about_finna-login.phtml') ?>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.finna.fi/MyResearch/Home?lng=en-gb">logging in to Finna</a> these functions are available to you with a library card for the library in question.</p>
      <p>An application for browsing <strong>archive</strong> material, that requires permission to use, can be made through links found in Finna content data.</p>
      <p>In the future, digital <strong>museum</strong> services will also be available in Finna.</p>
