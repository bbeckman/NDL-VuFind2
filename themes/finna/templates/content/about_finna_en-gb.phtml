      <h2>Other Finna search services</h2>
      <p>Finna is a search service containing several sites in addition to the nationwide finna.fi site. The content of organisation-specific sites is usually limited to the material from that individual organisation.
      </p>
      <p>Finna is continuously evolving, and will gradually replace the user interfaces of all Finnish libraries, archives and museums. At the moment, <a href="https://www.finna.fi/Content/organisations?lng=en-gb">more than 100 organisations</a> are involved in Finna, the following of provide their own Finna search functions:

      <p>At the moment, some Finnish libraries, archives and museums have yet to join Finna, but new organizations are continually enlisting. Our goal is that most national memory institution, including all public libraries, will adopt Finna by 2020.

      <h2>Digital resources</h2>
      <h4>International and scientific digital collections</h4>
      <p>Finna sites hosted by university libraries and libraries of the universities of applied sciences contain international, scientific and electronic library material compiled and provided by an outsourced party for a fee. Most of this material is limited to students and staff of the institutions of higher education in question. To access these digital resources log into <a href="#organisation-views">your library's Finna website</a> using the username provided by your institution of higher education.
      </p>
      <h4>Finna replaced Nelli</h4>
      <p>The Nelli portal, used by libraries to offer digital resources, particularly magazines, was one of the services replaced by Finna. Nelli was phased out from all Finnish libraries by the end of 2016. Nowadays, these digital resources are available from <a href="#organisation-views">your library’s local Finna website</a> or other service provided by your library for this purpose. Contact your library’s customer services team for more information.
